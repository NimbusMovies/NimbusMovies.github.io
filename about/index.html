        <h1 class="jumbo">About Me</h1>
        <h3 class="text">I was born in December 2002, I'm 12 and live in England. I was diagnosed with red-green colourblindness last year, when we did a science experiment on colours.
        <br />
        I am a web developer and Java/C++ dev. I develop sites like this one (which was hand-coded) and Java applets. I am a gamer at heart, and I spend most time playing Minecraft, but I am also known to grow on other sandboxes like Terraria and Garry's Mod.
        <br />
        I am a YouTuber that goes by the name of TheDiamondSword. I do gaming videos and some 'Let's Code' videos. Parts of the homepage were done in one of these said videos.</h3>
